PhysicistCreator
===================

A repository to house our Spark project
-------------------------------------

This repository is structured such that the directory unity holds most of our test scenes and the web directory holds our web-app.

To run the web-app:

`$ git clone https://github.com/gaspardetienne97/PhysicistCreator.git`

navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo and do :

`$ cd web`

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

Then follow the instructions in the terminal.
